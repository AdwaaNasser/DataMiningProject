## Problem

Air pollution poses a growing risk to both public health and the environment, with pollutants contributing to diseases and long-term ecological damage. This project is driven by the need to better understand how air quality is affected by different environmental and human factors. By analyzing trends in pollution data, including weather conditions (temperature and humidity), industrial activity, and population density, we aim to classify air quality levels and identify recurring patterns. The ultimate objective is to generate insights that support more effective strategies for managing and improving air quality.

## Objectives 

our project employs two complementary data mining techniques: classification and clustering.
1) Classification: The dataset will be used to develop a predictive model that categorizes air quality into three levels: Good, Moderate, and Poor. The model will incorporate multiple attributes, including pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO), weather conditions such as temperature and humidity, industrial proximity, and population density. The aim is to build a reliable system that can anticipate air quality outcomes based on these variables.
2) Clustering: This technique will be applied to group together records with similar environmental characteristics. By examining clusters based on pollutant concentrations and weather conditions, the analysis will reveal underlying trends and associations that are not immediately apparent. These insights may highlight typical pollution profiles and help explain recurring patterns in air quality.

## Project Motivation

As a team, we decided to work on the Air Quality and Pollution Assessment dataset because air pollution is a serious global problem that directly affects peopleâ€™s health. This dataset from Kaggle is valuable since it combines environmental and demographic factors, allowing us to explore both the causes and impacts of pollution. We were also inspired by a study in the Indonesian Journal of Data and Science that achieved 93% accuracy using this dataset, proving its potential for meaningful insights. Our motivation is to practice data science while addressing a real-world issue that matters to communities everywhere.
